title: "Getting RPG Maker MV working on Ubuntu Linux"

I ran into a couple of issues while trying to get RPG Maker MV working on my Ubuntu Linux installation.

Firstly, the playtest wasn't working. This was resolved by going into Steam, right-clicking RPG Maker MV and selecting properties. In the compatibility tab, I chose the legacy runtime 1.0. The playtest worked after this.

The second issue I ran into was that I was getting an error about an image file not loading once I started a new game. Checking the map file in the RPG Maker editor also showed that the image was not displaying. It turns out this was an issue with the capitalisation of the PNG extension on a file. Linux won't recognise ".PNG", so I had to rename the file ".png". Everything seemed to work OK after this.
